PyExifTool
==========

PyExifTool is a Python library to communicate with an instance of Phil
Harvey's excellent ExifTool_ command-line application.  The library
provides the class ``exiftool.ExifTool`` that runs the command-line
tool in batch mode and features methods to send commands to that
program, including methods to extract meta-information from one or
more image files.  Since ``exiftool`` is run in batch mode, only a
single instance needs to be launched and can be reused for many
queries.  This is much more efficient than launching a separate
process for every single query.

Getting PyExifTool
------------------

The source code can be checked out from the github repository with

::

    git clone git://github.com/sylikc/pyexiftool.git

Alternatively, you can download a tarball_.  

Official releases are on PyPI

::

    https://pypi.org/project/PyExifTool/


.. _tarball: https://github.com/sylikc/pyexiftool/tarball/master

Installation
------------

PyExifTool runs on Python 2.6 and above, including 3.x.  It has been
tested on Windows and Linux, and probably also runs on other Unix-like
platforms.

You need an installation of the ``exiftool`` command-line tool.  The
code has been tested with version 8.60, but should work with version
8.40 or above (which was the first production version of exiftool
featuring the ``-stay_open`` option for batch mode).

PyExifTool currently only consists of a single module, so you can
simply copy or link this module to a place where Python finds it, or
you can call

(It is being slowly re-factored to a module to keep exiftool.py from 
growing astronomically)

::

    python setup.py install [--user|--prefix=<installation-prefix]

to automatically install that module.

Testing
-------------

Run tests to make sure it's functional

::

    python -m unittest -v tests/test_exiftool.py
