      "The movie while not fantastic storywise was very  enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .",
